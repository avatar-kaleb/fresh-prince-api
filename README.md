# Fresh Prince Show (or your own) API with Node/GraphQL

## Reasons for the Repo
This repo isn't production ready or used in any apps, it's just my playground to learn Node and GraphQL, since the industry is going that way!

## Code taken from / based on Front End Masters: API Design with Node V2
I used the code from this course as a baseline to create this API, because the best way to really learn is doing :).

https://frontendmasters.com/courses/api-node-rest-graphql/ is the link to the course!

## How to use
Clone the repo, then use yarn to install.

Open up localhost:3000/docs for Graphiql interface

## Next steps
I'll be adding tests, db scripts, and more comments to better understand what's going on. Further, I'll be exploring nested mutations / resolves for the relationships within the models.

Lastly, I'll add some example screenshots and queries to get quotes from different characters!
